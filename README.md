6. Catastrophic disasters in Africa - (Environment)
Natural disasters such as drought and flooding often make survival difficult for people living in central Africa and near the equator. These communities are often forced to undergo rehabilitation. Using AI and studying past records of casualties and assistance provided during these disasters can help gain a deeper understanding of the situation. By analyzing this data, it is possible to develop solutions to minimize the risk and damage caused by these types of disasters in the future.

The African Centre for Meteorological Applications for Development (ACMAD) provides a wide range of data on weather and climate, including information on extreme events such as droughts and floods.

Key Features of your Solution:

Data Processing: The data from the African Centre for Meteorological Applications for Development (ACMAD) was preprocessed to handle missing values and transform variables if necessary.

Feature Extraction: Relevant features, including temperature, rainfall, and humidity, were extracted from the data to be used for predicting the impact of future disasters.

Model Training: A random forest classifier was trained on the data, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score on the testing data.

Predictive Capability: The trained model can predict the severity of future disasters, based on temperature, rainfall, and humidity.

Informed Decision-Making: The information generated by the model can be used to inform disaster response and recovery efforts, and to minimize the risk and damage caused by natural disasters in the future.

Potential for Further Research: This is just a preliminary analysis, and there is significant potential for further research and development in this area, including the use of additional data sources and more advanced machine learning techniques.
